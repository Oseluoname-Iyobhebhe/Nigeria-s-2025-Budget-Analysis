# Analysis of Nigeria's 2025 Budget






### Project Overview
In this project, I analyze Nigeria's 2025 budget, comparing capital expenditure across seven sectors (Works, Power, Health, Finance, Education, Defence, Agriculture). It includes structured data, visualizations, and trends to highlight fiscal priorities and sectoral investment changes.

### Data Sources
Data for this project was sourced from [Budget Office of the Federation](https://budgetoffice.gov.ng/index.php/resources/internal-resources/budget-documents). The Budget Office of the Federation, under Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget, and National Planning, is responsible for preparing and monitoring budgets, advising on fiscal policies, and publishing budget documents for transparency and accountability.

### Tools
- Google Sheet for data preparation
- Looker Studio for data visualization



### Data Collection
The data for this project was retrieved from [Budget Office of the Federation](https://budgetoffice.gov.ng/index.php/resources/internal-resources/budget-documents). The collected data includes detailed budget allocations for capital expenditure, recurrent expenditure, and statutory transfers, as well as a breakdown of sector-specific allocations.


### Data Preparation
After retrieving the data for this project, I structured it using tables to ensure it is well organized and ready for visualization. I also performed necessary data prepration, including verifying the accuracy of expenditure values and categorizing them appropriately for analysis.

### Findings
The 2025 budget reveals a total expenditure of ₦49.74 trillion, with projected revenue of ₦36.35 trillion, resulting in a deficit of ₦13.39 trillion. The expenditure breakdown is as follows:

- 32.8% allocated to debt servicing
- 29.9% to capital expenditure
- 28.4% to recurrent expenditure
- 8.9% to statutory transfers

### Recommendations

- Given the significant budget deficit, efforts should be made to increase revenue through diversification of income sources and strengthening non-oil sectors.
- A strategic approach to reducing debt servicing costs, such as refinancing high-interest loans and exploring debt relief options, should be considered to free up funds for critical development initiatives.
- Increased focus on capital expenditure can help stimulate economic growth and infrastructure development, which will provide long-term returns.
- There should be a push to improve efficiency in recurrent spending by reviewing public sector salaries, benefits, and operational costs, ensuring that funds are allocated to high-priority areas.
  
### Limitations
- The projection of revenue might not fully account for potential fluctuations in global oil prices or domestic economic conditions, leading to shortfalls.
- A substantial portion of the budget being allocated to debt servicing limits the government's ability to invest in other crucial sectors.
- Inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty may affect both revenue generation and the cost of capital expenditure, making budget projections subject to change.
- There may be difficulties in implementing the proposed fiscal measures due to political, structural, and logistical constraints, which could hinder budget optimization.
